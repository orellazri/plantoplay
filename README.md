## Behind the scenes

The server requests an access token from Twitch and caches it in memory alongside its expiration date to avoid excessive access token requests.

When a user signs up, it uses bcrypt to generate a salt in 10 rounds, and hashes the password before saving it to the database. It then signs a JWT and passes it to the client in an HttpOnly cookie.

The database has an intemediate `users_games` table to store the many-to-many relationship between games and lists of users. The list is an enum.

## Steps to run

First, you need to create an app in the Twitch developers website and supply the app with the client ID and client sercret (`.env` if you deploy manually or the `environment` section in the docker-compose file).

### Manually

Consult the readme files in both `server` and `client`.

### Docker

Copy `docker-compose.yml.example` to `docker-compose.yml` and update the values in `<>` accordingly.

Run `docker-compose up -d`

Connect to the server container's CLI and run `yarn run knex migrate:latest`. This creates the needed tables in the database.
